# Portfolio

In **Software Engineering I** at the Oregon State University (OSU), I participated in a class wide group project where we first came up with project proposals individually. Afterward, we all were assigned at random to a group of 5 people. 

Team members: 
-	Haya Ahmed
-	Ryan Alcorn
-	Marc Baiza
-	Shannon Farazi 
-	Matthew Koenig 

Professor Rooker provided us with a project topic that was also been selected randomly for us. Our project topic is: **Lost Pet Finder chip/app**. This proposal was submitted by **Keenon Hunsaker** who is our acting customer. Throughout the course of this quarter worked in collaboration with our customer as a group to bring his proposal to life. 

**Pawzzz** is a cross-platform (iOS/Android) pet location app using Xamarin Forms along with an ASP.NET Core REST API backend utilizing Microsoftâ€™s Cosmos DB. With this app, everyone can report their pet's status to other registered users in case they can't locate them. 

**The magic is in uniting pets with their owners**
