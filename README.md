# CS-361-Group-Portfolio

In our CS 361 class â€“ **Software Engineering I** at the Oregon State University (OSU), we are participating in a class wide group project where we first came up with project proposals individually. Afterward, we all were assigned at random to a group of 5 people. 

For **Group 16**, the five team members are: 
-	Haya Ahmed
-	Ryan Alcorn
-	Marc Baiza
-	Shannon Farazi 
-	Matthew Koenig 

Professor Rooker provided us with a project topic that was also been selected randomly for us. Our project topic is: **Lost Pet Finder chip/app**. This proposal was submitted by **Keenon Hunsaker** who is our acting customer. Throughout the course of this quarter will be working in collaboration with our customer as a group to bring his proposal to life.
